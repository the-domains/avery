One of my friends recently suggested some free, open-source art software called [Krita][1], and it's pretty great! (I'd say that it's the Blender of digital painting/drawing!)  

It's got a bunch of brushes, and even has a brush stabilizer, which Photoshop doesn't even have. Honestly, it's probably on the same level as Sai, only free.

It took me about 2 hours to do this doodle of an Alligator (which I've drawn a lot of recently), and [here is the image][2]I used as a reference.

LtCorbis is hilarious, and has literally gained 101k subscribers in a bit over 78 hours. 

I was inspired by Lt's sudden fame to create this GIF:

(She actually retweeted the GIF, so I'm legit)

And since Chrome extensions are now in style, I thought I'd put my HTML knowledge to use and make this chrome extension:

You can download it on the Chrome webstore at [Bit.ly/LTChr][0]! Enjoy... I guess!

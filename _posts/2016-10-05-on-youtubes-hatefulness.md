# On YouTube's Hatefulness

Over about the last year, I think there's been a lot of bad content put on the internet. (That's not new--- but I guess I started noticing it for the first time?) But dude! It's completely saturated at this point, and I need to vent somewhere.

I want to clarify that anybody should be able to criticize others (hopefully just when due)--- as I said in the _YouTube Needs to Stop_ video from a few weeks ago--- commenting or calling people out when they do something wrong is something that is critical, and even important in order to succeed; you need to learn from mistakes. That is not my problem.

My problem is when it is done for no reason. (I wrote a paragraph going into more detail, and even naming some names, but I scraped all of it in favor of this...) 

It boils down to this: everyone is a bit strange or different compared to other people, and everybody should go out and be their self, _unapologetically_--- of course__assuming hurting people (or living things, too) isn't your hobby. 

The best thing I've ever come up with to tell to someone who points out that I'm different or weird in some way is:

> Who cares?

I've been sick recently- I came down with a really bad cold. Not good. But, I do have a lot of spare time on my hands, so I started watching some videos by Aaron Blaise, and then I wanted to draw some of the characters from The Lion King (which I haven't seen in for ever-- sorta random, but hey, that's life ðŸ‘Œ.)

So, I found some reference pictures on Google Images, and here's some sketches that I made:

This last one is my favorite by far, and I think someday I'll have to re-draw it in Photoshop, because I think it would look great colored.

Below is a drawing I just finished making! I thought I'd practice my animation skills a few weeks ago by attempting to replicate a few frames of Vivienne Medrano's Die Young Animation. (Which just [hit 7 Million views][0], by the way!)

After finishing the latest Game Glitch episode, I thought I'd try to finalize the animation by going back and outlining the sketch... And after a few hours, I have just one frame.

But hey, that's pretty good. (Plus, it counter acts the two drawings of [iDubbbz][1] and JonTron I did.)

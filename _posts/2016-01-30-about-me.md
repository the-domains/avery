Hey! I'm Avery. I make a show about glitches called Game Glitch, and I'm currently doing a some photoshopping for the animated version of Zoophobia, and I made Trippy Fox's and Capticon's video intros. I use After Effects, Photoshop, Animate CC, and my Wacom tablet. Game Glitch videos are taking a really long time to make as of late! Sorry about that, expect at least one episode per month!

I also post my daily drawings at [adrawingaday.tumblr.com][0]!

You can find me on [YouTube][1], [Twitter][2], and [Tumblr][3]. And the internet in general.

  Hey! I'm Avery. I make a show about glitches called Game Glitch. I use After
  Effects, Photoshop, Animate CC, and my Wacom tablet. (Game Glitch videos are
  taking a really long time to make as of late! Sorry about that, expect at
  least one episode per month!)

I also post my daily drawings at [adrawingaday.tumblr.com][0]!

You can find me on [YouTube][1], [Twitter][2], and [Tumblr][3]. And the internet in general.

Hey! I'm Avery. I make a show about glitches called Game Glitch, and I'm currently doing a some photoshopping for the animated version of Zoophobia, and I made Trippy Fox's and Capticon's video intros. I use After Effects, Photoshop, Animate CC, and my Wacom tablet. Game Glitch videos are taking a really long time to make as of late! Sorry about that, expect at least one episode per month!

Hey! My name is Avery Miller. I make a show called Game Glitch, work in Adobe After Effects/Photoshop/Animate CC, and often attempt to draw and animate stuff. I've been interviewed on [NPR][0], made a website for [Rhett and Link][1], and I've done some photoshopping for the animated version of [Zoophobia][2]. 

You can find me on [YouTube][3], [Twitter][4], and [Tumblr][5]. And the internet in general.
